# dashboard

CoLibrary - dashboard project for The Odin Project

NEW AND EXCITING FOR ME:

- mutation observers
- creating classes and class inheritance
- 3d structure, learning from online tutorial and its source code
- horizontal scroll
- dark and light mode
- modal
- use of hsl colors
- dropdown button
- transitions
- creating svg in figma for website
- use multiple css and js sheets
- limit number of lines of text
- a lot of use of grid vs flex
- check color contrast for reading accessability
- use of prefers color scheme
- use of .style.setProperty instead of .style for css variables
- pretty good generalization of content by classes and structure, eg aside main container can have new divs added to it easily, same for books.
- pretty good generalization of css variables
- attempts at browser compatability, using caniuse.com to check compatability and ammending or changing where possible. not foolproof but better than previous sites.
- added credits on the website footer and inside the code itself

ISSUES OR MISSING:

- the announcements don't change on their own at set time intervals, is a good idea for the future
- add a button to go back to top
- light theme appearance is not the best
- when navbar is collapsed the names of the pages are not available, this makes sense but would be better to have them show on hover.
- also it's best if the navbar is "fixed" so that even if scrolling down a lot (which would happen when browsing books) it's possible to open the navbar and use them as usual.
- the books should obviously be entered from an excel with sql or smth like that, as a matter of fact this is a good potential project to add backend to in the future. For now since there aren't a lot of books, adding them in the js is alright.
- search bar isn't actually functional, would be good to add this as well in the future when learning how to.
- more generalization of css with classes
- more mobile fallback, no hover etc
- better browser compatability knowledge and experience
- better accessability knowledge and experience
- the books remain open/overturned where left, meaning that i can have all the books open at the same time. It's best if the books return to their default when clicking on a different one.
